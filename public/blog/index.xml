      <description>Hi. This post is my personal reference for functional programming with purrr package. I often find myself to search on google/stackoverflow “how to” iterate over this and that so it make sense to put it together somewhere. This post is vastly based on brilliant Jenny Bryan´s purrr tutorial and focus on nested lists / list-columns.
library(repurrrsive)library(tidyverse)Two datasets from repurrrsive package to practise on:
got_char Game of Thrones characters datasetgh_repos Github repositories datasetStart simpleusing str and it´s max.</description>

      <description>Recently I decided to use Google´s Photos app to manage all my photos. My collection is about ~7000 photos so it took me some time to create the albums and organize it. My intention was to do a back up from time to time using Google Takeout to keep the photos backed-up outside cloud as well.
Google Takeout is a service for everyone with Google account allowing the users to download back any previously updated data.</description>

      <description>In this post I will demonstrate how to display your Google Photos on a map. As you probably know, most of today´s mobile devices or cameras allow to record GPS position during taking the photos.
If you are using Google Photos you can leverage Google Takeout for this task. Google Takeout is a service for anyone with Google account allowing the users to download back any previously updated data.</description>

      <description>There is some discussion in local news regarding decrease of precipitation and increase of temperature over last decades, however I haven´t seen single proof of these claims. The goal of this post is to get relevant data and check the trend.
library(tidyverse)library(rvest)library(lubridate)library(RSelenium)library(scales)No open data? - scrap itI thought our institutions are more open in providing wheater data (temperature and precipitation) so I was disappointed finding out the only option to get monthly data is to scrap it.</description>

      <description>library(tidyverse)library(rvest)library(httr)library(scales)library(broom)I was wondering what is the current price of my car on the market. One way how to get some at least bit objective value is based on current situation on the market. I´m about to use simple (yet effective) web scraping technique to retrieve data from local best known internet car marketplace.
First step - how many pages?As a first step we need to find out on how many pages are the offers related to the same type of my car.</description>

      <description>Recently I have read on R weekly post about using image recognition engine by Google tesseract package. This package provides tool for optical character recognition (OCR) - simply allows to retrieve text from images. Tesseract is used for text detection on mobile devices, in video, and in Gmail image spam detection. How cool is that? Let´s try it too.
library(tidyverse)library(magick)library(tesseract)Sample imageWe need some testing image. I´m curious especially how well it perform on product labels like serial numbers, etc.</description>

      <description>I have started to run a bit about two month ago and a I was told the good way to track your fitness level and to train is to monitor your heart rate and to run according to heart rate zones. So I did some “research” and bought fitness tracker from Samsung. In order to set-up heart rate zones you need to know your resting heart rate and your max heart rate.</description>

      <title>Loading multiple *.csv (*.xlsx) effectively</title>

      <description>This brief post is a “how to” load multiple csv / xlsx files into single data frame. Say, we have a couple of *.xlsx files in one folder (some of them in sub-directories) and we would like to bind them all into one. Quite common task. Let´s do it:)
library(tidyverse)library(readxl)Step 1list.files function with argument full.names = TRUE (preserving complete path to all files) and argument recursive = TRUE is handy in case your files are in any level of sub-directories (represented with “next_level” folder in my case).</description>
