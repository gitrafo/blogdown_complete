<p>We do face a ton of charts and graphics these days showing us terrible increase of confirmed Covid-19 diseaase across the globe. The total numbers are important but I was suprised I couldn´t find some comparison of daily inrease of confirmed cases in percent. Even at WHO site.</p>
<p>That is way I decided to put together this <a href="https://datahost.shinyapps.io/covid/">Shiny app</a> to have a fast comparison.</p>
