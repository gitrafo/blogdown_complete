This post is my personal reference for functional programming with `purrr` package. I often find myself to search on google/stackoverflow "how to" iterate over this and that so it make sense to put it together somewhere. This post is vastly based on brilliant Jenny Bryan´s purrr [tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/) and focus on nested lists / list-columns.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(repurrrsive)
library(tidyverse)
```

Two datasets from `repurrrsive` package to practise on:

* `got_char` Game of Thrones characters dataset.
* `gh_repos` Github repositories dataset.

# Start simple
* using `str` and it´s `max.level` and `list.len` argument
* using `View()` function in RStudio

```{r}
# is it even list?
got_chars %>% class
```

```{r}
# list.len limits each nesting level to x items (by default list.len = 99)
# in case of more nested lists use max.level argument, by default all levels are shown
got_chars %>% str(list.len = 3)
```
So `got_char` is a list of 30 lists, each with 18 items.

We can get this information this way too:
```{r}
# number of items (lists in this case) at level 0 
got_chars %>% length()
# number of items at level 1
got_chars %>% map_int(length)
```
Or using `View()` function in RStudio. I prefer it.

..down to 30 lists

Now I want all items just from first list:
```{r}
got_chars[1] %>% str
```
Here is good to realize: </br>
a) that single `[` returns always list </br>
b) even if 5th element is pulled, the index of outcome will be 1, not 5.
```{r}
got_chars[5]
```
Now, I want all content of items just from first list:
```{r}
# outcome is a list again but with one level only
got_chars[[1]] %>% str
```
Good to realize:
```{r}
got_chars[1] %>% names
```
vs.
```{r}
got_chars[[1]] %>% names
```
Extract `name` from each list:
```{r}
got_chars %>% map_chr(~.$name)
```
or
```{r}
got_chars %>% map_chr(~.x$name)
```
or
```{r}
got_chars %>% map_chr("name")
```
or straight to tibble:
```{r}
got_chars %>% map_df(~.[c("name", "gender")])
```
What if I want "aliases" too? 
```{r, error=TRUE}
got_chars %>% map_df(~.[c("name", "gender", "aliases")])
```
..it doesn´t work beacause some characters have more than one aliase.

But this does:
```{r}
# alias will be list-colum ("nested")
df <- tibble(
  name = got_chars %>% map_chr("name"),
  id = got_chars %>% map_int("id"),
  gender = got_chars %>% map_chr("gender"),
  aliases = got_chars %>% map("aliases")
)
df
```
..it works because alias is bind as list-colum ("nested")

Using `unnest` comes handy now? Nope yet..
```{r, error=TRUE}
df %>% 
  unnest()
```
..it is because some of alias has NA (NULL) value (# NULL are the list-col equivalent of NAs):

```{r}
df$aliases %>% map_lgl(is.null)
```
We can use `replace_na` to replace NULL to "" or whatever and `unnest` afterwards.
```{r}
df %>% 
  replace_na(list(aliases=list(""))) %>% 
  unnest()
```
# To tibble asap
..extracting using mutate+map+unnest </br>
..allows iterative approach - more decomposed code and faster debugging

### a) directly to tibble
```{r}
tibble(name = got_chars %>% map_chr(~.$name)) %>% 
  mutate(id =  got_chars %>% map_int(~.$id)) %>% 
  mutate(aliases =  got_chars %>% map(~.$aliases)) %>%
  replace_na(list(aliases = list(""))) %>% 
  unnest(aliases)
```
### b) `set_names` and `enframe` the list (in fact it is directly to tibble too)
```{r}
got_chars %>% 
  set_names(., got_chars %>% map_chr(~.$name)) %>% 
  enframe(name = "name", value = "data") %>% 
  mutate(id = data %>% map_int(~.$id)) %>% 
  # or
  mutate(id_2 = data %>% map(~.$id) %>% unlist) %>% 
  mutate(aliases =  data %>% map(~.$aliases)) %>%
  replace_na(list(aliases = list(""))) %>% 
  unnest(aliases, .drop = FALSE)
  
```
# More nested stuff
```{r}
# explore gh_repos list
gh_repos[[1]] %>% str(max.level = 4, list.len = 4)
```
or again using `View()` function in RStudio. I prefer it because you can easily miss something when using `str` (yes, it sounds strange, but that is my experiance with complicated lists). There are two major advantages:

1) Using `View` you can explore single element down to latest element without extending the list with other elements (unlike `str`) </br>
2) Using `View` you can get direct address to now-matter-how-much-scary-nested element (can be done with `str` too actually, but more complicated way)

![](/img/purrr_2.png){width=100%}

or

```{r}
# number of item at level 0
gh_repos %>% length()
```

```{r}
# number of item at level 1
gh_repos %>% map_int(length)
```
```{r}
# number of item at level 2
gh_repos %>% map(map_int, length)
```
..more about last one later </br>
..`gh_repos` is list of 6 lists, each with 30 (except one with 26 lists), each with 68 items

```{r}
# exctract name
gh_repos %>% map(~.[[1]][["name"]])
```
..but it is NOT correct. Why? Because this is just item "name" from each first sub-list. We need somehow iterate over index map_chr(~.[[i]][["name"]])

```{r}
gh_repos %>% map(function(x){map_chr(x, ~.$name)
  }) %>% 
  str()
```
That´s it! </br>
or
```{r}
gh_repos %>% map(map_chr, ~.$name) %>% 
  str()
```
That´s it again. </br>
or
```{r}
gh_repos %>% modify_depth(2, ~.$name) %>% 
  str(list.len = 4)
# modify_depth is a little bit difficult to abstract and the disadvantage is that it return list only, there isn´t modify_depth_char equivalent
```
Now, we will extract `owner` list, more specifically `login` variable. We can notice it is duplicated in each list = useful to set as name. The index = 1 is OK as we will extract just one (first) item from list as all others are the same.
```{r}
# extract login
gh_repos %>% map_chr(~.[[1]][["owner"]][["login"]])
```
or
```{r}
# extract login
gh_repos %>% map_chr(~.[[1]]$owner$login)
```
or
```{r}
gh_repos %>% map_chr(c(1,4,1))
```
# The best practise - put it all together
```{r}
# explore the list first with View() or str, understand the data
# put list into tibble using enframe (list must have names) or set_names first = get the address to logical element for your names
gh_repos %>%
  set_names(., map_chr(gh_repos, ~.[[1]]$owner$login)) %>% 
  enframe(name = "name", value = "data") -> t 
t
```
..here is good to realize that `data` is basically replicated `gh_repos`.
```{r}
# now mutate whatever you want by extracting using mutate + map depending on level of nest
t %>% 
  mutate(package = data %>% map(map_chr, ~.$name)) %>%
  # the index = 1 is OK here as we will extract just one (first) item from sub-list as all others are the same.
  mutate(owner_url = data %>% map_chr(~.[[1]]$owner$url)) %>% 
  unnest(package, .drop = FALSE)
```
