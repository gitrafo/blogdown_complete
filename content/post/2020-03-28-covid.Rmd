We do face a ton of charts and graphics these days showing us terrible increase of confirmed cases of Covid-19 disease across the globe. The total numbers are important but I was suprised I couldn´t find some comparison of daily inrease of confirmed cases in percent.

That is way I decided to put together this [Shiny app](https://datahost.shinyapps.io/covid/) to have a fast comparison.
