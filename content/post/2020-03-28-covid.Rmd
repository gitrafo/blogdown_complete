We do face a ton of charts and graphics these days showing us terrible increase of confirmed Covid-19 diseaase across the globe. The total numbers are important but  I was suprised I couldn´t find some comparison of daily inrease of confirmed cases in percent. Even at WHO site.

That is way I decided to put together this [Shiny app](https://datahost.shinyapps.io/covid/) to have a fast comparison.
